## About UltraRepo Builder

UltraRepo Builder is a free AI coding tool that allows you to use **local AI services** at no charge, or your own remote AI services accounts from OpenRouter, xAI, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and more. We're building in a set of repository tools that will extend the range of AI LLMs to well beyond the typical 1MB context window.

**Problem:** Nearly all IDEs utilize remote, cloud based AI services. While remote services can be very useful for persistence across projects and as a team resource, often we desire the privacy, control, performance and financial freedoms that only a private AI infrastructure can provide. One huge problem: AI IDEs have poor memory, and a context window of 1MB is completely inadequate for most professional dev projects.

**Solution:** UltraRepo Builder for VS Code is designed to provide developers with local control over all elements of their dev environment. With a set of advanced coding tools, MCP Hub services and more, UltraRepo Builder extends the capability, reliability, accuracy and context window of typical AI IDEs.

## Relationship to Other Projects

UltraRepo Builder is based on Kilo Code/Roo Code.
